                    disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in
                    Wuhan
                    China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as
                    COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for
                    disease.
                    Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

                  <p>

                    A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
                    The
                    virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the

                    and cause mild

                    causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this
                    disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’
                    ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel
                    coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

                    There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild
                    upper-respiratory
                    tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not
                    previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health
                    Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.

                    People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support.
                    Counter
                    stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not
                    target
                    specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop
                    stigma.

                    People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or
                    visiting
                    areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can
                    lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in

                    Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is
                    associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about
                    disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                  <p>
                    Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease
                    that is causing the problem.

                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                    others,
                    such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                    between
                    people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.
                    Middle

                    This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first
                    infections
                    were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                    person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on
                    a
                    continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses
                    are
                    less so.

                    The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community
                    (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been
                    infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became
                    infected.

                    The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with
                    COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be
                    isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better
                    and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation
                    is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control
                    experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including
                    disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case
                    basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least
                    24 hours apart.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to
                    others.

                    It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other
                    viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean
                    it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not
                    known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more
                    to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and
                    investigations are ongoing.

                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.
                    Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before
                    preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20
                    seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose,
                    coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus
                    on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be
                    the main way the virus spreads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very
                    low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks
                    at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                    Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and
                    through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen
                    cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
                    have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so
                    check regularly for the latest news.

                    You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
                    precautions:

                        alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

                    <li>
                      <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
                        sneezing.</p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">why?</span>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small
                        liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
                        breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

                        Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the
                        virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering
                        your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the
                        used tissue immediately.</p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">why?</span>Droplets spread virus. By following good
                        respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and

                        attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</p>National
                      and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area.
                      Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health

                    Household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting may have close
                    contact2 with a person with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under
                    investigation. Close contacts should monitor their health; they should call their healthcare
                    provider right away if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness
                    of breath)

                      instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home
                      and provide support for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare
                      provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the
                      healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from
                      getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for
                      additional guidance. If the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the
                      dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as much as
                      possible. Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home.

                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air conditioner or an
                      opened window, weather permitting.
                    </li>
                    <li>Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20
                      seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all
                      surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be
                      used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.

                    </li>
                    <li>The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the patient is not able
                      to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver,
                      should wear a mask when you are in the same room as the patient.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient’s blood,
                      stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.

                        <li>When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves. Then,
                          immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove
                          and dispose of facemask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or
                          alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses,
                      cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient uses these items, you
                      should wash them thoroughly (see below “Wash laundry thoroughly”).

                    </li>
                    <li>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures,
                      toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that
                      may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
                      <ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
                        <li>Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain
                          instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you
                          should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good
                          ventilation during use of the product.

                        </li>
                        <li>Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your

                        </li>
                        <li>Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general,

                      before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an
                      alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items. Soap and water should be
                      used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.

                    If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take
                    everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away
                    from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise
                    travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as
                    possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
                    More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers
                    can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.

                    Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after
                    someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
                    looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of
                    masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and
                    mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks).

                    The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your
                    hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter
                    (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new
                    coronavirus for more information. </p>

                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
                    patients
                    may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.
                    These
                    symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                    develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                    disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                    COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                    those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                    diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and
                    difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                    medical
                    provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC

                    causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. In the early stages of
                    infection,
                    it is possible the virus will not be detected.

                    symptoms
                    likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.

                    This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not
                    seem
                    to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is
                    happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that
                    impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school
                    dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school
                    dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare
                    arrangements, if needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or
                    school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do
                    from
                    home to keep up with their schoolwork.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is
                    dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

                    Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions
                    to
                    reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media
                    sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your
                    child’s
                    school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from

                    or

                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                    respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                    COVID-19
                    associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                    your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                    the
                    day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                    bathroom.

                  <p>
                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                    that
                    has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                    but
                    this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                    is
                    likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over
                    a
                    period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                    No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself
                    against
                    the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based
                    hand
                    rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry
                    them
                    thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.

                  <p>
                    Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e.
                    have
                    a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new
                    coronavirus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.
                    This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become
                    sick and develop a fever.

                  <p>
                    No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus
                    influenza
                    type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are
                    trying
                    to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against
                    respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
